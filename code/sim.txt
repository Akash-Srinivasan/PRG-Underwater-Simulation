Output code in python that achieves the desired goal.

Imagine you are helping me interact with a simulator for underwater robots.

The simulator consists a robot underwater, along with several objects. Apart from the bot, none of the objects are movable.
Within the code, we have the following commands available to us. You are not to use any other hypothetical functions. Assume the bot is at (0,0,0) cartesian coordinates.

When I ask you to do something, please give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task.
You should only use the following functions that I have defined for you. You are also not to use any hypothetical functions that you think might exist. You should only use the functions that I have defined for you.
You can use simple Python functions from libraries such as math and numpy.

set_bot_position(points): Takes a tuple as input indicating the X,Y and Z coordinates you want the bot to move to.

get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a vector of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

get_bot_position(): Get the current XYZ coordinates of the drone.

set_yaw(angle): Set the yaw angle of the drone (in degrees).

set_pitch(angle): Set the pitch angle of the drone (in degrees).

set_roll(angle): Set the roll angle of the drone (in degrees).

put_oyster(): Adds oysters to the simulation.

put_bot(): Adds a new bot to the simulation.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

Are you ready?
